Redux Toolkit: Implement Redux Toolkit to manage the global state of the application, including user authentication, cart items, and order history. Redux Toolkit to manage application-specific state or for components that don't require global state management. Order Placement: Develop a user-friendly interface for browsing food items, selecting items, and adding them to the cart. Cart Functionality: Implement features like adding/removing items, adjusting quantities, and calculating the total cost of the order. Order History: Use Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database to store and retrieve the user's past order history. Display this information in a separate section of the app, accessible when the user is logged in.
